## Overview

Development of a flexible frontend by using Next.js.

## Key Features

- **Component Library**: Built a set of modular, reusable UI components using React and styled-components in Next.js, focusing on accessibility and responsiveness.
- **Theming and Customization**: Integrated a theming system that allows easy switching and customization of color palettes, typography, and layout styles using CSS variables and Figma tokens.
- **Figma Integration**: Collaborated closely with designers by setting up a shared design library in Figma. This library was synchronized with the codebase, ensuring design handoffs were seamless and that design tokens remained consistent across both platforms.
- **Collaboration with Project Owner**: Developed a product under the PO direction, usage patterns, and best practices, ensuring the product meet the customers need.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For fast, server-rendered React applications.
- **Styled-Components**: For styling React components with a modular, themable approach.
- **Postman**: For test fetching data from backend.

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was complexing of the project when it growth and have more modules. The solution involved creating agreements in developer team to follow the same guidlines. Additionally, setting up effective collaboration workflows between Project Owner and developers using Figma and daily scrum was a learning experience that greatly improved the process.

## Outcome

The project still in the MVP phase but it has work seamlessly. Our team are developing on a new features, fewer design inconsistencies and fix some errors.
